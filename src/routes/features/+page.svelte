	<h1>Features</h1>
	<p>Before we talk about the actual features themselves, let's talk about</p>
	<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>
	<p>
		Since using AI and storing Data somewhere isn't free, especially not at scale, you can purchase
		this product for <strong>$20</strong>. It is a one-time purchase with no subscription tied to it
		and you have full access to all features.
	</p>
	<h2 id="ai-features">AI Features</h2>
	<p>
		Since I feel uncomfortable using AI for <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>, I narrowed it down to just
		use it for <strong>Event Generation</strong>. The AI will understand what you are saying and
		convert it to a full event with all properties assumed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Why? Because I think clicking through menus after menus is very tedious and has a lot of
		friction. Just having one text field is much more convenient and with the good understanding
		capabilities of <em>GPT-4o</em> everything gets done for you. To not skyrocket my OpenAI bill, I
		have set the amount of requests to 10 per hour.
	</p>
	<h2 id="all-features">Other Features</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Cloud saved events</li>
		<li>Tagging</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="planned">Planned Features</h2>
	<p>
		This app is of course at an early stage of production and I have more plans for this. A big goal
		is definitely going in the direction of collaboration.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Projects (containers for many events)</li>
		<li>Shared Projects</li>
		<li>Shared Events</li>
	</ul>
