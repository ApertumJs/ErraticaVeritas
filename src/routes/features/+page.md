Before we talk about the actual features themselves, let's talk about

## Pricing

Since using AI and storing Data somewhere isn't free, especially not at scale, you can purchase this product for **$20**. It is a one-time purchase with no subscription tied to it and you have full access to all features. Your payment is securely processed with **Stripe**. You can pay with every popular credit card, as well as with **Apple Pay** and **Google Pay**.

## AI Features

Since I feel uncomfortable using AI for **EVERYTHING**, I narrowed it down to just use it for **Event Generation**. The AI will understand what you are saying and convert it to a full event with all properties.

Why? Because I think clicking through menus after menus is very tedious and has a lot of friction. Just having one text field is much more convenient and with the understanding capabilities of **GPT-4o** the task or event will be generated. To not skyrocket my OpenAI bill, I have set the amount of requests to 10 per hour.

Right now, this is the only AI-powered feature, but I am planning to add recommendations for when you want to add an event to a project, but that has to wait for a future release.

## Projects

In Zenith, you have the ability to organize your events into projects. In a future iteration you will be able to share them with other users. Projects consist of a title and an optional deadline.
